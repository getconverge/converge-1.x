			</xs:annotation>
		</xs:attribute>
		<xs:attribute name="Vocabulary" type="xs:string">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The Vocabulary attribute, if present, provides a pointer to a TopicSet which is the controlled vocabulary that can be used to resolve the meaning of the FormalName. The value of the Vocabulary attribute is an http URL or a NewsML URN, or the # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the a TopicSet in the current document. If there is no Vocabulary attribute, then the controlled vocabulary to be used is located by the following algorithm: - Proceed to the parent of the current element. - If it has a Catalog element as its immediate child, see whether that Catalog contains a Resource element whose DefaultVocabularyFor child contains an XPath pattern that is matched by the current element. If so, then the controlled vocabulary is the resource identified by that Resource element. - If the parent does not meet the above condition, proceed to its parent and check the same condition. - Continue until a vocabulary is found, or no further parent elements are available because the root element has been reached and it too fails to meet the condition.</xs:documentation>
			</xs:annotation>
		</xs:attribute>
		<xs:attribute name="Scheme" type="xs:string">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The Scheme attribute, if present, serves to distinguish which of possibly multiple naming schemes in the controlled vocabulary is the one that governs this FormalName. For a match to be obtained within the controlled vocabulary, the rule is that the FormalName and the Scheme must both match. If there is a Scheme attribute on the current element, then both the FormalName and the Scheme in the controlled vocabulary must match. The controlled vocabulary will be located either through the Vocabulary attribute (if present) or through the appropriate Catalog entry where the Context matches the current element. If a Vocabulary attribute is present that points to a TopicSet then the FormalName may be resolved using this TopicSet. This overrides any relevant Catalog entry.  If there is no Scheme attribute on the current element and no Vocabulary attribute then a Scheme may be assigned through as follows: If the Catalog, within the instance or externally referenced from the instance, contains a Resource element with a DefaultVocabularyFor child element with a Context attribute that matches the current element and a Scheme attribute with a value declared, then this Scheme may be applied when resolving the current element FormalName. If the DefaultVocabularyFor has no Scheme value then a match will be to an item in the vocabulary that has the current FormalName and no Scheme.</xs:documentation>

		<xs:attribute name="Duid" type="xs:ID">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>Duid is a "Document-unique Identifier". It must satisfy the rules for XML ID attributes: it must only contain name characters, and it must start with a name-start character (not a digit). Its value must be unique within any NewsML document. Every NewsML element type has Duid as an optional attribute.  Combined with the Identifier element, providing a value for the Duid of any element in a NewsML document makes the element globally identifiable. The Identifier element gives global identification to the document, and the Duid provides local identification for the element within the document.</xs:documentation>
			</xs:annotation>
		</xs:attribute>
		<xs:attribute name="Euid" type="xs:string">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>Euid is an "Element-unique Identifier". Its value must be unique among elements of the same element-type and having the same parent element. Use of Euid attribute makes it possible to identify any NewsML element within the context of its local branch of the NewsML document tree. This makes it possible to copy, or include by reference, subtrees into new combinations in ways that would break the uniqueness of Duids (thereby forcing new Duids to be allocated), but still being able to retain the identity of each element. If Euids are maintained at every level, it is possible to identify, for example "The ContentItem whose Euid is abc within the NewsComponent whose Euid is def". Such identification patterns would be preserved even after "pruning and grafting" of subtrees.</xs:documentation>

The optional Topic attribute may be used as a direct pointer to that Topic. The pointer may take the form of an http URL or a NewsML URN, or a # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of a Topic element in the current document.

			<xs:documentation> The date and (optionally) time at which a piece of metadata was assigned. 
				Uses the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS{+or-}HHMM (year, month, day, time separator, hours, minutes, seconds, timezone separator, hours, minutes). If only the Date is needed, then the substring from T onwards may be omitted. Where the offset difference is +0000 the letter suffix "Z" may alternatively be used. 
				This is the Basic Format defined by ISO 8601.  YYYY is a 4-digit year number. MM is a 2-digit month number. DD is a 2-digit day number. T is the letter 'T'. HH is a 2-digit hour number (using a 24-hour clock). MM is a 2 digit minute number. (Note that midnight may be represented as 240000 on the date of the day that is ending, or as 000000 on the date of the day that is beginning.) 
				{+or-} is the '+' character or the '-' character, and the following HHMM are hours and minutes of offset from Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC) as defined by ISO 8601. If the time is being expressed in UTC, then the timezone offset may be '+0000' or '-0000'. If the time is behind UTC, the timezone separator is '-'. If the time is ahead of UTC the timezone separator is '+'.
				Example: 10:27 p.m. in New York on 31 December 2000 would be expressed as "20001231T222700-0500" as New York is five hours behind UTC in winter. At the same moment in London, the date and time would be expressed as "20010101T032700+0000" or as "20010101T032700-0000" because in London it is now 3:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001. At the same moment in Paris,the date and time would be expressed as "20010101T042700+0100", because Paris is one hour ahead of UTC in winter and it is now 4:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001</xs:documentation>
